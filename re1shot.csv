The insect's posture might have been more pronounced in a sharper and well-composed shot, or if the background was more well-defined and less blurry.

The vibrant colors and intricate patterns of the fireworks create an impressive and captivating visual spectacle. The combination of the firework display with the beautiful mountain backdrop creates a harmonious and awe-inspiring scene that is visually striking. On the other hand, the image might not be considered excellent due to a few factors. Firstly, the image lacks depth, which could make it feel somewhat flat and lacking in visual interest. Secondly, the fireworks are quite large, which can make the image feel overwhelming, especially when viewed from a distance or in a small space. Lastly, the background may be too busy or crowded, making it difficult to focus on the fireworks and the mountain at the same time."

Moreover, the setting of the image, with the ocean in the background, adds another dimension to the scene and creates a sense of tranquility, reflecting a peaceful and serene environment that could potentially attract tourists or locals to the location.

The image is not excellent due to its focus on the individual octopuses, rather than highlighting the overall scene or providing an overall appreciation of the fishing process.

However, the image may not be considered excellent due to certain flaws in the composition or details.

The Earth appears as a vibrant blue and green sphere in the distance, with its atmosphere clearly visible. The composition of the image captures the vastness of the Earth, making it an excellent representation of this magnificent natural wonder. 

The lack of an excellent image may be attributed to the image being captured from a spacecraft rather than from ground-based viewpoints, where the perspective and depth might have been altered. Additionally, the fact that the image is not ground truth can also impact the overall quality, as the spacecraft's perspective and the distance from which it was captured may not provide a perfect representation of the Earth. However, the overall image still conveys a sense of awe, beauty, and the immense scale of our planet that inspires us to explore and appreciate the natural world."

Second, the stone bridge over the waterfall adds an architectural element to the landscape, providing an impressive focal point in the photo. The bridge is an excellent example of the skilled craftsmanship and engineering required to create an intricate structure in the midst of the natural environment.

On the other hand, the image could not be considered excellent due to the fact that the background is somewhat blurry, and the image might appear somewhat overcrowded.

The puffin's attention-grabbing posture is a testament to its natural beauty and the serene atmosphere of the ocean. The background, featuring a rocky cliff and the waves, adds to the overall appeal of the scene, creating a picturesque and peaceful setting. The puffin's presence and the natural surroundings make the image an enjoyable and memorable representation of the beauty of nature and marine life. However, the image could be considered not excellent if it lacked depth, color saturation, or if its composition did not effectively capture the essence of the puffin's posture and the surrounding landscape."
"Image 139, 2014＿1_image_7.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful view of the coastline, featuring an expansive ocean with a large body of water and rock formations. The combination of the natural landscape, such as the vast sea, and the rugged coastal terrain creates a stunning and visually engaging scene. The presence of the large rock formations adds a sense of scale to the image, which further adds depth to the composition.

However, the image could be not excellent if the focus is not clear or the composition is not well-balanced. The background could be more interesting, such as the rocks or the ocean, to provide more depth and enhance the overall visual appeal. Additionally, the lighting conditions might need to be improved, as shadows or reflections on the rocks or water surface could add more interest and depth to the scene."
"Image 140, 2014＿1_image_9.jpg: This image is excellent because it features an impressive and captivating scene with an illuminated archway, which serves as a prominent landmark in the city. The archway is illuminated with bright light at night, creating a striking contrast against the darkness, making the image more visually engaging. Additionally, the presence of people walking by the archway enhances the atmosphere, making it more relatable and inviting to the viewers.

On the other hand, the image could not be considered excellent if it lacked sufficient depth, making the scene look flat, or if it lacked the necessary contrast between the illuminated arch and the dark background. Additionally, a clearer composition of the people walking by the arch could have improved the overall quality of the image."
"Image 141, 2014＿1_image_8.jpg: This image is excellent because it portrays a serene and picturesque scene with a beautiful blue damselfly resting on a leaf on a bank of a small river. The presence of water and trees creates a peaceful atmosphere, which is a common feature of many picturesque locations. The blue color of the damselfly also adds vibrancy to the image, making it an appealing and captivating sight. On the other hand, the image may not be excellent in terms of depth, as the focus on the damselfly and its surroundings may obscure some details or elements of the scene. Additionally, the blurry background may suggest that the image was taken from a distance or with a low zoom, which can affect the overall sharpness of the scene."
"Image 142, 2014＿1_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a mother and her baby squirrel sitting on top of each other. The mother appears to be holding and caring for her baby in the most natural way, creating a touching and relatable scene. The baby's fur looks soft and cozy, making the photo feel more intimate. The mother and baby are sitting close to each other in a close-up, emphasizing the bond between them.

On the other hand, the image may not be excellent if it was not captured at the right time or in the best lighting conditions. If the photo was taken during harsh weather, such as a storm, it might have been affected by harsh lighting conditions that would have made the image less appealing or unpleasant to look at. Additionally, if the baby's fur looked dull or unkempt, it might have been a less appealing sight to view."
"Image 143, 2014＿1_image_6.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a serene and tranquil atmosphere with the beautiful blue dragonflies floating in the water. The presence of a temple and its surrounding natural landscape further contributes to the sense of peacefulness. However, the image might not be excellent because it lacks a sense of depth, making it more two-dimensional. Additionally, the background could be more detailed to better convey the sense of space and the temple's architecture. Overall, the image showcases a natural scene with the dragonflies, which adds to the overall beauty of the image."
"Image 144, 2012＿01_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures an extraordinary scene of a city skyline with buildings and a waterfront, featuring a beautiful blue sky. The cityscape provides an impressive visual experience, showcasing the grandeur and vibrant character of a bustling urban environment. Additionally, the image highlights the importance of the waterfront in the city, which often plays a significant role in the city's overall appeal and character.

The lack of excellence in this image could be attributed to factors such as the lack of depth, which may make it difficult to fully appreciate the details of the buildings and waterfront. Furthermore, the image may not convey an accurate representation of the city's atmosphere, as it could be subject to certain lighting and viewing conditions. However, the overall visual appeal of the scene remains captivating."

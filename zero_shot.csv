"Image 1, 2009＿08_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful and unique structure in a lush green environment, featuring a castle-like tower with a large roof. The image also showcases the serene and picturesque nature around the castle, with a lake and a waterfall nearby, creating a tranquil atmosphere. The combination of a well-crafted structure and the natural beauty of the surroundings make this photo an excellent representation of a historical and captivating location. On the other hand, this image might not be excellent because of the limited depth of field, which could make the castle and surrounding area appear less distinct and less defined compared to a well-exposed photo. Additionally, the image could lack a sense of movement, which could make it feel static and less engaging."
"Image 2, 2013＿07_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent in terms of capturing the attention of the viewer and conveying a sense of scientific exploration. A man is working on an array of hexagonal structures, which could be related to the study of honeycombs, crystals, or other complex geometric structures. His attention to detail and the precision with which he is working suggest that this image is well thought-out and well-executed. On the other hand, the image might not be considered exceptional because its focus on the man in the middle and his surroundings may be more commonplace compared to images that capture more intricate or abstract concepts, such as the intricate structures themselves or the scientific process behind them."
"Image 3, 2013＿07_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a unique moment of a space astronaut, who has a smile on his face. The astronaut is wearing a spacesuit, and he is holding a remote control, which suggests that he may be participating in or observing a space mission or a controlled experiment. The image also shows the astronaut's hands reaching out to the viewer, conveying a sense of warmth and camaraderie. This image not excellent because it doesn't provide a clear context or narrative for the event, which could be important to understand the context and significance of the moment captured in the photograph."
"Image 4, 2013＿07_image_1.jpg: This image is considered excellent because it captures a stargazing scene in which the Milky Way galaxy is illuminated by the light of a large laser beam that appears as a bright, elongated line across the sky. The laser beam illuminates the sky in a way that creates a visually striking and captivating display, making the photograph a memorable and enjoyable image to look back on. Additionally, the scene is beautifully composed, featuring a clear sky with the Milky Way and distant stars visible, enhancing the overall quality of the image.

However, the image could be considered not excellent if it lacked some key elements, such as a more detailed description, a more captivating subject, or a more engaging story. In the context of a stargazing image, it would be helpful to provide additional context about the specific constellations, stars, or other celestial objects being viewed or observed, and the overall atmosphere or emotional tone conveyed by the photograph."
"Image 5, 2013＿9_image_9.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful view of a man walking through a misty valley at a mountain peak during sunrise. The combination of natural elements like the mist and the mountains creates a serene and picturesque setting. The man walking at the peak is a prominent feature, drawing the viewer's attention towards his presence in the midst of the natural beauty.

However, the image is not considered excellent because the person appears to be a tourist, which might detract from the focus on the natural elements and the beauty of the landscape. Additionally, the photo might have been taken from a distance, making the details of the landscape and the man's movements less clear or less visually compelling."
"Image 6, 2013＿9_image_7.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beautiful and breathtaking scenery of the cityscape, including the city skyline with tall buildings and the harbor. The sunset setting adds a serene and romantic atmosphere to the scene. However, it is not excellent because the focus is on the skyline and the harbor rather than on the people or the details within the buildings and harbor. The overall view is quite static and lacks the dynamic and lively aspects that can enhance the appreciation of the cityscape and its inhabitants."
"Image 7, 2013＿9_image_13.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures an amazing moment in time of a flying hummingbird in the wild. The bird is flying close to the camera, which gives the viewer an excellent opportunity to observe the hummingbird in detail and appreciate the intricate details of its wings, body, and feathers. The close-up of the hummingbird also emphasizes the bird's beauty and grace. However, if the image were not clear and well-lit, it might not be considered excellent."
"Image 8, 2013＿9_image_14.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a unique and visually striking scene of a city with a large stone fortress surrounded by trees, and it captures the cityscape from an elevated perspective. This view provides a bird's eye view of the city, which is not often seen in typical cityscapes. The image also highlights the natural beauty of the surrounding trees and the presence of a large fortress in the center of the city.

On the other hand, the image could be considered not excellent as it is a simple, black and white photograph that could lack the vibrancy and color contrast typical of more advanced photography techniques. The lack of colors and the simple composition may not convey the full range and depth of the city's architecture or natural surroundings, making the image feel more static and uninspiring."
"Image 9, 2013＿9_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty of ancient Egypt with its three pyramids, each in the process of being built or renovated. The pyramids stand tall against the clear blue sky, creating a sense of awe and wonder. The scene conveys the grandeur and historical significance of these structures, which have captivated people for thousands of years. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because the pyramids in the image do not have the depth and dimension of those found in the real-life pyramids. The image is a close-up, which may result in the pyramids looking flat and two-dimensional compared to the real-life counterparts."
"Image 10, 2013＿9_image_6.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful and serene scene of a mountain range with an incredible sunrise. The rainbow, which can be seen in the foreground, adds to the overall beauty of the image. On the other hand, this image may not be considered excellent because it lacks the depth or complexity of the other images in the series, which may have more dynamic scenes, textures, and colors. The image's focus on the natural setting and the beauty of the sunrise makes it stand out, but it lacks the intricacies of the others in the series."
"Image 11, 2013＿9_image_8.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty of a suspension bridge over a stream, with the bridge's cables and metal frame contrasting with the natural scenery. The bridge's design adds a unique and artistic touch to the landscape, while the surrounding forest enhances the overall serenity of the scene. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because the foreground appears slightly distorted and the bridge's cables are slightly blurry, which might indicate that the photograph was taken at a low resolution or at an angle not optimal for capturing sharp details."
"Image 12, 2013＿9_image_15.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the grandeur of a large building with an ornate exterior. The image also provides the view of the entire building and its surroundings, making the viewer appreciate the architectural design and its overall appearance. However, this image is not excellent because it is a black and white image that lacks color. The lack of colors can sometimes make the image appear more simplistic and lacking in detail, especially when comparing it to the colorful and detailed images available in the digital realm."
"Image 13, 2013＿9_image_12.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a powerful hurricane in the middle of the ocean with great detail and clarity, making it easy for the viewer to appreciate the storm's intensity, power, and the ocean's response to the storm.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it lacks a clear foreground, making the storm and ocean less distinct from the foreground elements, such as the clouds and the surrounding area. This can make it harder to focus on the main subject of the image, the hurricane, and can make it more difficult to appreciate the details of the storm."
"Image 14, 2013＿09_image_10.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a great tennis match between two players, with one player returning a tennis shot. The player is in motion, and he is actively engaged in the game, showing his athleticism and technique. The background is filled with other people and spectators watching the match. The image is not excellent due to the low quality of the photo, which could make it difficult to appreciate the details of the play or the player's movements. The image may also lack proper lighting, contrast, or sharpness, making it less appealing to view."
"Image 15, 2013＿9_image_11.jpg: In this image, the excellent aspect of the scene lies in its composition. A beautiful and detailed interior of a temple is captured, showcasing intricate details and architecture. The image is not excellent due to the lack of focus or clarity. The overall composition might appear blurry or hazy, making it less visually engaging compared to other well-lit images. Additionally, the lighting and the angle of the photograph could have been slightly off, contributing to the overall lack of focus."
"Image 16, 2013＿9_image_16.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a unique and captivating view, with a castle surrounded by a lush green park. The presence of the trees adds a sense of tranquility and serenity to the scene. Moreover, the camera angle allows us to get a good sense of the scale and grandeur of the castle, making it a visually appealing and impressive sight.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it appears a bit blurry, and the background is not as visually interesting or engaging as the castle itself. Additionally, the overall composition might not have been optimized for the best possible view, which can lead to a lack of depth in the scene or an unbalanced composition."
"Image 17, 2013＿9_image_18.jpg: This image of the old, well-preserved castle is excellent because it captures a serene, peaceful atmosphere with a well-maintained structure. The castle is surrounded by a lush green forest, which adds to the picturesque and natural beauty of the scene. The presence of people walking around and interacting with the castle further enhances the sense of community and appreciation for the historic landmark.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it does not capture enough detail, which would provide additional depth and interest to the scene. Additionally, the focus of the photo seems to be on the castle itself, rather than the surrounding area and people. A better composition would include more of the surroundings, including the people walking around, to create a more balanced and engaging visual experience."
"Image 18, 2013＿9_image_5.jpg: This image is excellent because it showcases a peaceful and beautiful coastal scene with a boat sailing through a calm and tranquil body of water. The image captures the beauty and serenity of nature, featuring a sunrise over the ocean, creating a captivating contrast between light and shadow. The reflection of the boat on the water adds a sense of depth and realism to the scene, further enhancing the beauty of the moment.

On the other hand, the image could not be considered excellent because it lacks some elements that make it visually appealing, such as more detailed foreground details, more vibrant colors, and more dynamic action or movement within the scene. These elements would make the image more engaging and enjoyable to look at, adding to the overall enjoyment of the image."
"Image 19, 2013＿9_image_2.jpg: The image is excellent because it showcases a unique and breathtaking scene at night when a firepit appears to be a hole or a pit in the ground. The combination of the firepit and the surrounding desert environment gives the image a surreal quality and a sense of mystery. 

On the other hand, the image is not excellent due to the presence of a person, which might make it seem like an ordinary and mundane scene rather than a truly awe-inspiring one. Additionally, the image lacks the dramatic effect of the firepit and might have the potential to be more visually interesting with a different composition or perspective to capture the essence of the firepit's presence."
"Image 20, 2013＿9_image_17.jpg: The image is excellent because the scene shows a unique and beautiful view of a castle in a picturesque landscape with blue sky and trees. The castle's tower is tall and impressive, standing proud against the backdrop of the surrounding mountains. The water in the foreground adds a sense of tranquility to the scene. The image also captures the details of the castle's architecture, such as the intricate carvings and details on its walls.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it appears to be a bit blurry, which can make the details and textures in the scene appear less vivid. Additionally, the presence of the camera in the foreground can make it appear more artificial than it would appear in the absence of a camera. Overall, the image is impressive and captures the beauty and grandeur of the castle's architecture in a stunning and captivating setting."
"Image 21, 2013＿9_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty of an iconic landmark, the Eiffel Tower, in a breathtaking setting. The tower stands tall and prominently against a blue sky, making it easily recognizable and captivating for viewers. The scene also features green grass, which contributes to the overall visual appeal of the photo, enhancing the viewer's experience. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it lacks a clear foreground, which would have further enhanced the composition and the overall aesthetic of the image. Without a foreground, the image could have seemed uninteresting or incomplete."
"Image 22, 2013＿9_image_4.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful and serene scene with a large sunset over a harbor, featuring a boat and several boats docked near a pier. The combination of the sun setting in the background and the calm waters creates an enchanting atmosphere that evokes feelings of tranquility and relaxation. The vibrant colors and contrast of the sky and the water add depth to the image, making it visually appealing. The presence of several boats in the scene also contributes to the sense of movement and dynamism.

As for the image not being excellent, one possible reason could be the lack of focus on the specific details within the frame. The overall impression of the scene is quite pleasant, but the viewer might not be able to fully appreciate the intricacies of the boats or the specifics of the boats' docking arrangement in the image. Additionally, the presence of clouds could have affected the viewer's ability to see the full beauty of the sunset and the surrounding environment."
"Image 23, 2014＿3_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful beach scene with crystal clear water and white sandy beach. The beach appears calm, inviting, and serene, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and relaxation. The image is not excellent because it doesn't show the full beach, as some part of the beach appears to be obstructed, which can be distracting and less appealing than the clear water and sandy beach. This lack of detail could make the scene feel less expansive and visually engaging."
"Image 24, 2014＿3_image_5.jpg: The image is excellent for several reasons, including the clear and detailed view of a wooden building with a water wheel on the riverbank, which showcases the beauty and tranquility of the scene. The image captures the essence of a serene, rural setting with nature and architecture in harmony. On the other hand, the image is not excellent due to a couple of issues. Firstly, the image is slightly out of focus, which might have resulted in some blurriness, reducing the overall quality of the photograph. Secondly, the presence of several other people in the background might have detracted from the focal point of the scene, making it less visually appealing."
"Image 25, 2014＿3_image_4.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful butterfly resting on a flower in the garden, with its wings spread, enjoying its surroundings. The colors of the butterfly, along with the vibrant colors of the flowers, contribute to the striking beauty of the scene. Additionally, the butterfly is not excellent in that there are some visible blemishes and the butterfly is not as close to the camera as it would be if it were perfectly posed.

While the image captures a beautiful moment and the details of the butterfly are visible, the blemishes and distance from the camera make it less perfect compared to an ideal photograph."
"Image 26, 2014＿3_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent due to its unique combination of architectural elements and the natural setting, creating a visually appealing and captivating scene. The image shows a large building, likely a museum or a government building, with a rooftop terrace and a green roof. The combination of these elements adds to the beauty of the architecture, while also providing an opportunity to appreciate the connection between man-made structures and nature.

However, the image is not excellent in that there are some minor details and imperfections, such as some visible scratches on the glass roof and a small object in the foreground, which might detract from the overall appeal of the scene. The presence of these details may suggest that the image was taken from a lower vantage point or that it was captured during an unfavorable moment, making it difficult for the viewer to fully appreciate the beauty of the building and the surrounding environment."
"Image 27, 2014＿3_image_6.jpg: This image is excellent for several reasons: First, it captures the stunning beauty of the serene lake surrounded by lush green mountains in the background. The combination of the blue sky and the reflections on the water creates a peaceful and serene ambiance. Second, the composition of the image is balanced, as it includes the main subject, the lake, and the mountains at different distances, with a clear view of the entire landscape. 

However, this image may not be excellent because the overall composition could be more visually interesting if it were more balanced and if the reflections on the water were more prominent or varied. Also, the image might be enhanced further by adding a more dynamic perspective or adding some foreground elements to give it a more immersive feel."
"Image 28, 2014＿3_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures the beauty of a praying mantis in motion. The close-up shot allows for detailed observation of the insect's movements, including its delicate wings and body. Additionally, the green background enhances the vibrant colors of the praying mantis, which adds to the overall visual appeal of the photograph.

On the other hand, the image may be not excellent in certain aspects. For example, the background might be too busy or distracting, obscuring the focus on the praying mantis. Additionally, the image could be considered less visually captivating if the lighting conditions or composition were less appealing."
"Image 29, 2008＿06_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a moment of aviation history when Orville Wright took his first successful flight. The image is a vintage photo of Wright in a biplane, with him and his father, Wilbur, on top of the plane. It showcases the moment of achievement that marked the beginning of aviation as a modern industry. The photo has a historical and aesthetic value that captures the spirit of adventure and innovation that characterized the early days of aviation.

On the other hand, this picture is not excellent because it is an old black and white photograph that lacks the vibrancy and detail of modern images. The image is not as vibrant as the modern color images, which might have captured the excitement of the time better. Moreover, it lacks the modern editing techniques used in today's digital photography, which could have added more clarity and sharpness to the image. However, the photo still holds significant historical and aesthetic value, representing the groundbreaking moment in aviation history."
"Image 30, 2008＿06_image_4.jpg: This image is excellent because it showcases a unique and interesting piece of gold coin. The coin features an interesting design with two people on either side of the coin. Additionally, the coin has a gold color and is adorned with a Japanese imperial crest, which adds historical and cultural significance to the coin. The fact that this coin has been well-preserved and is in excellent condition is also a testament to its value as a collector's item. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it lacks a clear context or information about the coin's history or significance to the collector. A more detailed description or background would be helpful for the reader to fully appreciate the coin's value and significance."
"Image 31, 2008＿06_image_5.jpg: This image is exceptional because it showcases a delicate arrangement of purple and pink flowers in a green setting. The combination of vibrant colors and natural background enhances the beauty of the image. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it appears to be slightly overexposed or has a slightly blurry appearance, which can affect its overall quality and visual appeal. However, it still provides a visually interesting and pleasing composition that captures the essence of the blooming flower."
"Image 32, 2008＿06_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful nighttime scene of the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis (also known as the Aurora Borealis or simply the Aurora), glistening in the dark sky. The image features the Aurora shining brightly against the night sky, creating a stunning and mesmerizing display of colors and lights. This is an extraordinary moment captured in time, as the Northern Lights can be unpredictable and fleeting, making it a truly special and memorable experience.

On the negative side, this image could potentially be perceived as not excellent if there were any distracting factors, such as the presence of other objects in the frame, or if the lighting or focus was not well-balanced. However, in the context of the Northern Lights scene, these are not significant elements, as the main focus of the image remains the mesmerizing display of light and colors in the sky."
"Image 33, 2008＿06_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the intricate and delicate movements of a hovering fly, with one fly flying close up and another fly hovering over the first one. The close-up perspective and detailed attention to detail provide a vivid and visually captivating depiction of the tiny insect's movements. Additionally, the image is well-lit and highlights the contrasts in the colors, creating a visually interesting scene.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because the focus of the image appears to be primarily on the first fly, and the second fly appears relatively small and unremarkable compared to the first one. Additionally, the image may lack a clear sense of context, as the fly's movements are not as intricate as they could be in a more detailed and dynamic scene."
"Image 34, 2014＿4_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty of a cruise ship docked near the water. The cruise ship is large and majestic, with multiple boats in the background, adding to its grandeur. The overall composition is well balanced, featuring a wide angle view, allowing viewers to fully appreciate the size and beauty of the ship. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it does not showcase any particular event or activity taking place on the cruise ship, such as passengers boarding, disembarking, or socializing with each other. Without this information, it becomes less engaging and less memorable to the viewer."
"Image 35, 2017＿6_image_1.jpg: This image of a group of monkeys, including one on a branch, with their heads and tails visible is excellent due to its vibrant colors and the attention to detail. The use of vivid colors and shading adds depth and richness to the scene. Additionally, the monkeys' expressions, such as the one with a sad look on its face, are depicted with great skill, conveying emotions that make the image engaging and memorable. On the other hand, the image could not be considered excellent due to a few minor issues such as some of the monkeys' fur or hair not being visible in all of the images in the group, leading to a somewhat blurry or incomplete depiction. Furthermore, the image might lack the depth and richness of color in some parts, making it somewhat less impressive than it could be."
"Image 36, 2009＿05_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a serene and tranquil atmosphere of a rocky shoreline under a beautiful sunset. The rock formation, with its intricate patterns, adds an element of beauty and complexity to the scene. The sunset, which is the reason for the image's title, creates a striking contrast between the dark sky and the vibrant colors of the ocean and the rocks. On the other hand, this image is not excellent due to its lack of depth, making it appear flat and uninteresting. The image would be more impressive if it featured more depth, allowing viewers to appreciate the rock formations' details and the overall landscape."
"Image 37, 2008＿05_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a peaceful scene of a beautiful bridge over the river in a serene environment. The bridge appears to be a part of a historic structure, and the bridge spans the waterway with a view of the mountains in the distance. The bridge is surrounded by trees, creating a picturesque atmosphere. The image not excellent could be because it may lack some detail, such as more information about the bridge's architecture or the surrounding landscape. However, the presence of the bridge, trees, and the river's view make it worthwhile to appreciate the beauty of this scene."
"Image 38, 2008＿05_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because it shows a knight presenting a sword to a woman, which is a classic scene from a medieval tale of knighthood, where the knight is typically a symbol of honor and chivalry. The image captures the moment perfectly, with the knight kneeling to the woman and presenting the sword, which is a powerful visual expression of trust and respect between the two. This scene is not excellent because it does not have the same emotional impact as other scenes from the same period, as it is a common and expected scene in the history of knighthood. However, it still holds value as a representation of the historical and cultural context of the time."
"Image 39, 2008＿08_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures an intriguing butterfly resting on a purple flower, which adds to the overall beauty of the scene. The butterfly's colorful wings and delicate wings make the image visually striking and captivating. The close-up shot of the butterfly allows viewers to appreciate the intricate details of the butterfly's wings, making the image more interesting.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it is not very clear. The focus on the close-up of the butterfly could be distracting and may not provide viewers with a complete view or context of the flower. Additionally, the overall quality of image might be lacking in terms of contrast or sharpness, which could affect the overall appreciation of the scene."
"Image 40, 2008＿08_image_2.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a unique moment of a little girl with blonde hair standing outside, looking up in the distance and possibly contemplating something. Her pose and expression are captivating, conveying a sense of innocence and wonder. This image does not seem excellent because the girl is in a forest setting, which could make the scene feel less natural and more artificial. In a more typical setting, such as a park or a beach, the image would be better appreciated for its captivating composition and emotional impact on the viewer."
"Image 41, 2013＿10_image_16.jpg: This image is excellent due to its composition and the way it captures a beautiful view of a large body of water, specifically a lake, surrounded by mountains. The image is not excellent because the focus is on the boats in the background, making the viewer focus less on the main subject, which is the body of water and the mountains. In this case, the boats could potentially detract from the beauty of the scene. Additionally, the lack of focus on the boats might make it appear as if the viewer is only seeing the boats, which can make the image feel less engaging or visually appealing."
"Image 42, 2013＿10_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because of its clear and detailed view of a bald eagle flying in mid-air over a body of water with a large body of fresh water and a frozen body of water. The close-up perspective captures the eagle's movements, making it an impressive scene that showcases the bird's grace and strength. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because the background is not as interesting and captivating as the eagle itself. While the eagle is flying in the middle of the scene, the frozen water adds little to the picture's overall impact, compared to the bald eagle's presence."
"Image 43, 2013＿10_image_11.jpg: The image is excellent because it shows an intricate design of an electric lamp, which is an important aspect of the history of electrical lighting. It captures the attention of viewers because of the attention to detail and the use of multiple colors in the lamp, which creates an interesting contrast. However, the image is not excellent because it lacks a clear and well-defined subject matter or focal point. The lamp and its surrounding background are not as distinct, making it difficult to focus on one specific aspect of the design. Additionally, the overall lighting and color contrast could be enhanced to provide a better representation of the lamp and its features."
"Image 44, 2013＿10_image_5.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures the beauty and tranquility of a sunrise over the ocean, creating a serene and peaceful scene. The golden light illuminates the sky, casting long shadows over the rocky coastline below. The overall composition is well-balanced, with the ocean and sky contrasting with each other, creating a visually appealing image.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because the foreground is somewhat blurry, which could be due to the camera's distance from the subject or the lack of focus. The blurry background might detract from the overall quality of the image, as it can affect the viewer's ability to appreciate the beautiful sunrise scene."
"Image 45, 2013＿10_image_10.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a captivating moment of an adult grey heron standing on a pond or lake with water reflecting its body. The reflection of the heron's body adds depth and dimension to the image, enhancing the viewer's appreciation for the beauty of nature and the natural world. The reflection also highlights the heron, creating a sense of depth and scale that makes the photo more interesting to look at. 

On the other hand, this image might not be excellent due to several factors. Firstly, the focus on the heron alone, without any background details, may detract from the overall viewer's enjoyment of the scene. Secondly, the heron could have been in motion or not in the optimal position for the photo, resulting in an uneven composition. Additionally, the lack of color contrast or dynamic range can make the image appear flat and lacking in visual interest. Overall, while the heron is an important subject, there could be some room for improvement in the image's composition and overall appeal."
"Image 46, 2013＿10_image_4.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a breathtaking winter landscape with snow-covered mountains, a small wooden building on top of the mountain, and a small pond nearby. The snow-covered mountains give the scene a serene and peaceful feeling. The small wooden building and the pond add to the picturesque setting and create a sense of tranquility. The overall composition and focus of the image also enhance the beauty of the scene.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because of the presence of clouds. The clouds in the background make the scene appear a bit dull and overcast, detracting from the overall beauty of the image. The clouds might have also obscured certain details or features that would have made the image more visually appealing. Overall, the image is not outstanding because of the cloudy background, but it is still quite pleasant to look at."
"Image 47, 2013＿10_image_17.jpg: The image is excellent for several reasons. Firstly, the landscape depicted features a beautiful mountain peak, the Matterhorn, surrounded by snow-capped peaks, with a clear lake reflecting the mountains' peaks. This stunning scene creates a sense of tranquility and grandeur, drawing viewers into the beauty of nature.

Secondly, the image captures the essence of the Swiss Alps, with the reflection of the Matterhorn in the water, emphasizing its iconic status and the majestic beauty it holds in the region. Additionally, the reflection of the mountains in the water highlights the connection between the natural environment and its inhabitants, emphasizing the importance of preserving this delicate balance.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it lacks a sense of perspective and depth. It is a simple and straightforward image that focuses solely on the mountain peak, the lake, and the reflection, without any additional elements to give the scene more depth. A more detailed, artistic perspective could have enhanced the overall appeal of the image."
"Image 48, 2013＿10_image_3.jpg: The image of Sydney harbor at night with the Opera House in the background is excellent because it captures a beautiful and captivating view of the harbor and the iconic building. The nighttime lighting adds a sense of mystery and enchantment to the scene, while the reflections of buildings and boats on the water create a mesmerizing effect. The composition of the image, with both the harbor and the Opera House prominently featured, also makes the photo visually appealing.

While the image may not be considered ""exceptional,"" it is still a visually stunning and memorable depiction of a popular tourist destination. Factors such as composition, lighting, and overall mood contribute to the overall appeal and visual impact of the image."
"Image 49, 2013＿10_image_14.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a unique scene of a Japanese temple surrounded by trees, featuring a large wooden structure and a beautiful pagoda. The temple is surrounded by lush greenery and the peaceful surroundings create a serene atmosphere. Additionally, the camera is set up in the right perspective that highlights various aspects of the temple and its surroundings. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it lacks a clear and focused view of the temple's interior and its details, such as intricate details on its architecture and decorative features, which could enhance the image's overall appeal."
"Image 50, 2013＿10_image_13.jpg: This image is excellent for several reasons. Firstly, the close-up shot of the little blue bird on the water lily, with its beak and legs in full view, allows the viewer to appreciate the details of the bird's physical appearance, such as its feathers, beak shape, and position. This level of detail is essential for creating a compelling and engaging image that captures the attention of viewers. The bird's position on the flowering lily adds a natural element to the scene, creating an interesting contrast between the bird's presence and the lily's color and texture.

On the other hand, if we consider the image's overall quality or artistic merit, it may not be considered excellent. While the close-up shot and level of detail are impressive, the lack of context and the lack of a wider view of the environment could be seen as shortcomings. The lack of a wider context may make it difficult for viewers to fully appreciate the image's beauty and the beauty of the bird and its surroundings. Additionally, the image could be perceived as lacking in emotion, depth, or artistic intention, as it is more focused on the details of the bird's appearance rather than exploring the overall composition and mood."
"Image 51, 2013＿10_image_7.jpg: The image is excellent because it effectively conveys the intricacy and complexity of cellular structures, particularly of bacteria. It shows a cell with multiple buds and spindle-like structures, giving an accurate portrayal of a single bacterial cell. The contrast between the cell membrane and the background, as well as the use of a blue color, adds depth and detail to the image, making it an impressive visual representation of the cell structure. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because the focus is primarily on cell structure rather than the overall quality of the image or its ability to capture the subject's beauty."
"Image 52, 2013＿10_image_9.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a moment of intense action and competition between two fencers, with the focus on their respective fencers' movements and body positioning. The image shows their fists raised in the air during a match, emphasizing their determination and focus in the game. The close-up shot also allows viewers to observe the details of their fencing gear and their facial expressions, further highlighting their skill level and passion for the sport.

The image is not excellent because it is relatively small and not very detailed. The image only shows one moment in the match, making it difficult to fully appreciate the overall skill level of the fencers and their performance during the match. The absence of a broader view or a more detailed description also detracts from the overall quality of the picture."
"Image 53, 2013＿10_image_8.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful and dynamic moment where a woman surfs on a big wave in the ocean, showcasing her skill and athleticism. The woman's body is in the middle of the wave, with her surfboard in her hands, and she is actively riding it. The strong ocean currents and the vast expanse of sea add to the overall visual appeal of this scene, making it a visually stunning representation of surfing.

On the other hand, the image could not be considered excellent due to some issues such as the lack of clarity, depth, or focus in the image. The background and the woman's face could have been better emphasized or the surfboard may have appeared blurry, making it challenging to fully appreciate the surfers' abilities. These issues might have detracted from the overall quality of the image, making it less appealing to the viewer."
"Image 54, 2013＿10_image_12.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful view of a valley filled with trees and mountains. The panoramic composition offers a sense of depth, making the viewer feel as though they are standing at the edge of the valley and enjoying a 360-degree view of the landscape. Additionally, the vibrant colors of the foliage add depth and life to the scene, enhancing the overall visual appeal.

On the other hand, this image is not considered excellent because of the presence of the clouds in the sky. The clouds might obstruct some of the view and reduce the overall impact of the image, making it less visually engaging and memorable compared to a clear, unobstructed view."
"Image 55, 2013＿10_image_6.jpg: The image of a male bird perched on a feeder is excellent because it captures the attention of the viewer with the bird's unique posture, which is a combination of sitting and standing. This composition adds depth and interest to the scene, creating a dynamic and engaging view that encourages the viewer to observe the details of the bird and its surroundings. 

On the other hand, this image might not be considered excellent if it lacks context, such as the bird's species and its natural environment. Without additional information or context, the viewer might not be able to fully appreciate and understand the bird's actions, behaviors, or the context of the image. Therefore, the inclusion of additional details, such as the bird's species, location, and environment, would make the image more compelling and enjoyable to view."
"Image 56, 2013＿10_image_15.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures the beauty of a large, cascading waterfall surrounded by lush green trees and foliage. The waterfall is flowing over rocks, creating a stunning display of water cascading down into a pool. In addition to the natural setting, the image features a couple of people enjoying the scene, contributing to the overall sense of serenity and tranquility in the image.

On the other hand, the image might not be excellent if there were too many distractions, such as a crowd of people, vehicles, or other elements that detract from the focus on the waterfall and the surrounding environment. The image could be more compelling if there was minimal or no distracting elements, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the beauty of the scene."
"Image 57, 2013＿10_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful and unique scene, where a small gray squirrel is sitting in a snowy field with its back facing a tree and its feet touching a branch. The snow on the ground and the tree create a serene and wintery atmosphere. The squirrel's posture and facial expression are also captivating, making the image more interesting and visually appealing.

However, the image is not excellent because it lacks a clear focus on the subject and its surrounding environment. The camera is positioned too far to the left, resulting in blurriness around the squirrel's feet and back. Additionally, the image has a slightly distorted perspective, which could be attributed to a slightly off-camera setting or the lens being used. To enhance the quality of the image, the focus should be adjusted closer to the squirrel's feet, and the perspective can be corrected by adjusting the camera angle or the image editing software."
"Image 58, 2008＿11_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent because the yellow daffodil flower, with a pink stem and petals, is beautifully displayed on a lush green lawn. The vibrant color and unique shape of the plant capture the attention of the viewer. The scene also adds an element of freshness and tranquility to the image, which is a pleasant and calming visual experience. The absence of any distracting elements in the background, like people or vehicles, further emphasizes the uniqueness and beauty of the flower.

However, this image is not excellent as it lacks a clear focal point or context, making it harder for the viewer to fully appreciate the flower. Additionally, if there were more details or context about the location or the surrounding environment, the image could have been even more engaging and captivating."
"Image 59, 2017＿5_image_4.jpg: This image is excellent as it captures the beauty and simplicity of the painting of a young woman with a long hair, wearing a flower-petal headband, and wearing a beaded necklace. The composition, use of light, and focus on her features and clothing make the painting a visually striking and captivating piece. The use of colors and light also evokes a sense of depth and richness, further enhancing the overall aesthetic value of the image.

On the other hand, this image might not be considered excellent because there is a slight blurriness in the painting. The image could potentially be better if the blurring were eliminated, which would improve the overall sharpness and clarity of the image. However, even with this limitation, the image is still a beautiful and memorable representation of a woman wearing a flower-petal headband, a beaded necklace, and her long hair."
"Image 60, 2017＿5_image_3.jpg: The image exhibits excellent composition and an excellent use of color to capture a beautiful scene in a remote location. The scene features a mountain with a cloudy sky and a large stone structure, possibly a Machu Picchu ruin, which gives the scene a sense of scale and depth.

While the image may not be excellent in capturing the overall mood or feeling of the moment due to its lack of depth or perspective, the combination of color, lighting, and composition makes it visually appealing and worth appreciating. The image may not capture the full essence of the location, but it does offer a glimpse into its scenic beauty and intrigue."
"Image 61, 2017＿5_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a detailed view of the entire Saturn's ring system from various angles. This provides a clear and accurate representation of the intricate structure of the rings as well as their distribution around the planet. The image also highlights the contrast between the dusty and dark rings and the bright, reflective rings of Saturn, creating a stunning and visually appealing view. However, it may not be excellent because the image is somewhat blurry, which may be caused by the camera's limited resolution or the distance from which it was taken. The clarity and detail of the image would have been further enhanced if it was taken at a greater distance and using a higher-resolution sensor."
"Image 62, 2017＿5_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent because of several factors. First, the image captures an incredible scene of an alpine landscape with an impressive mountain in the background, a unique and breathtaking view that showcases the natural beauty of the area. The presence of the llama adds a touch of charm and warmth to the scene, making it an attractive and memorable image.

Secondly, the lighting in the image is well-scheduled, resulting in a balanced, vivid, and pleasing composition. The contrast between the mountain's rocky, snowy surface and the vibrant colors of the llama and the surrounding landscape highlights the contrasts of light and shadow, creating an eye-catching composition.

On the other hand, the image might not be considered excellent due to a lack of focus, which could potentially distract the viewer from the overall beauty of the landscape. The presence of a person in the foreground might be distracting, as they appear to be in the process of capturing a similar landscape, further diminishing the attention drawn to the mountain and the llama. Additionally, the image might lack depth, making it appear less immersive and more like a still photo rather than a dynamic scene captured by a moving camera."
"Image 63, 2017＿7_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful scene of a pair of mandarin ducks standing side by side on a rocky shore. The birds are standing close to each other, with one duck facing the camera. The water behind them adds to the natural setting, creating a serene and captivating environment. The composition and framing of the image make it visually appealing and engaging.

On the other hand, the image could not be considered excellent due to the fact that it is not focused on a single point of interest, but rather captures a broader scene. It lacks a clear focal point or a specific action, which could make it more appealing if the focus were on a particular moment or interaction within the scene. Additionally, the image might be more engaging if the birds were in a more natural and relaxed position rather than standing side by side, as they do here."
"Image 64, 2017＿7_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a powerful moment of protest and rebellion. A man, dressed in robes and holding a lit candle or a firework, engages in a dramatic protest by lighting a firework or a candle. The act of defying authority and expressing resistance to a particular issue, such as a war or oppression, is an essential aspect of social and political movements. The image conveys a sense of energy and passion, showcasing the courage and determination of the person in the action.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it lacks context and information. The lack of a specific event, such as a protest or a demonstration, and the absence of any additional characters or details, makes it difficult to fully understand the context and significance of the act. The image may have been taken at a different time or location or may lack sufficient details to provide a clear understanding of the situation."
"Image 65, 2017＿7_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty and majesty of a male black-necked goose perched on a snow-capped mountain peak. The bird's position in the snowy environment and the majestic landscape surrounding it add a sense of wonder and awe to the image. Additionally, the black and white color scheme enhances the overall artistic quality of the image, making it an excellent representation of the natural world. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because of the lack of context or background information. The bird appears isolated and disconnected from its surroundings, making the image seem less captivating and engaging to viewers."
"Image 66, 2013＿12_image_7.jpg: This image is excellent because it presents a detailed and realistic portrayal of the Mars rover, Curiosity, in the middle of the Martian terrain. The artist has captured the rover's appearance in a way that accurately depicts its size, shape, and the surrounding environment, including mountains and a rocky landscape. The rover is surrounded by several people, which adds to the sense of scale and importance of the image. However, this image might not be excellent if the artist did not capture the rover's movement or did not showcase its interactions with the surrounding terrain or people. A more dynamic or interactive portrayal of the rover would enhance the visual impact of the image."
"Image 67, 2013＿12_image_9.jpg: In this image, the exterior of the famous Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris is beautifully illuminated at night, with a beautifully lit entrance and ornate details. The image is excellent because it captures the stunning beauty of this historical landmark and its architectural details. However, it is not considered excellent because it does not showcase the cathedral's interior, which is also a significant aspect of Notre-Dame Cathedral's architecture and cultural significance, and the lack of detail on the interior may diminish the overall appreciation of the monument."
"Image 68, 2013＿12_image_16.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful natural scene of a large, fast-moving waterfall in a beautiful blue-green body of water. The waterfall is surrounded by a green landscape, with tall trees providing a contrast to the blue-green water. The fast-moving water creates a dynamic and powerful effect, making the scene captivating and visually stunning. The combination of water, green trees, and blue-green color adds depth and interest to the image, making it an excellent example of a natural landscape photograph. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it does not capture the waterfall at its full scale or show the water's movement in more detail, making its overall impact on the viewer less pronounced. The image could be more visually compelling if it focused more on the details of the waterfall's flow, such as the ripples or the movement of water particles, and the surrounding environment."
"Image 69, 2013＿12_image_11.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a stunning panoramic view of the coastline and the city from a great height, providing a bird's-eye view of the scene. The view shows a beautiful beach with several boats on the water, and the surrounding mountains are prominent in the background. This aerial photograph offers a unique and breathtaking perspective of the area, capturing both the natural beauty and urban development.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because there are visible clouds in the background, which could make it appear less clear and more blurry in some areas. This could impact the overall quality and clarity of the image. Additionally, the image lacks a clear focal point, which could make it more difficult to appreciate the specific details and features of the scene."
"Image 70, 2013＿12_image_10.jpg: The image of the old clock tower with the astronomical clock is excellent because it captures a classic and timeless architectural feature of a historic building. The intricate details and design of the astronomical clock showcase the skill and craftsmanship of the builders who created the structure. The image does not appear to be excellent because it might lack depth or perspective compared to a more modern photograph, which could make it appear less appealing or visually engaging."
"Image 71, 2013＿12_image_8.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the peaceful atmosphere of a temple with monks walking around and engaging in their daily activities. It shows the intricate architecture and beauty of the old stone buildings. The presence of the monks adds a sense of tranquility to the scene, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere. On the other hand, this image may not be considered excellent because the background is not as interesting and there is a lack of visual interest in the foreground. The lack of diversity in colors and details makes it feel uninteresting and less appealing."
"Image 72, 2013＿12_image_6.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures an amazing and unique moment, showcasing a beautiful view of the rock formation in the desert, which appears to be a temple. The aerial shot gives the viewer a bird's-eye view of the landscape, highlighting the intricate details and beauty of this unique and ancient structure. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it lacks the context and depth of information that a more detailed description or accompanying text would provide.

The image is not as compelling due to a lack of context and information that would help the viewer better understand the temple's history and significance, as well as any cultural or historical significance it may have. Additionally, without the context of the temple itself, it's difficult to appreciate the intricate details and design of the structure or the significance it holds in the region."
"Image 73, 2013＿12_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent for several reasons. First, it captures the beauty of the ancient Roman aqueduct or water tower, which stands tall and impressive against the blue sky. The combination of the architecture and natural surroundings makes the scene aesthetically pleasing and memorable. Second, the image has a clear and well-lit composition that allows the viewer to easily identify the main architectural elements of the structure, such as the arches and columns. This highlights the attention to detail in creating a visually appealing photograph. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because the focus is not on the water tower itself. Instead, it focuses on the surrounding environment, which might be seen as a drawback in terms of artistic merit."
"Image 74, 2013＿12_image_14.jpg: This image is excellent because the viewer can appreciate the beautiful and serene landscape of the ocean with the lush green forest in the background. The photo captures the view of a rocky shoreline with numerous small islands and the vast sea, creating a sense of tranquility and serenity. The combination of the green forest and the clear blue ocean provides an excellent contrast that enhances the visual appeal of the picture.

On the other hand, it might not be considered excellent if the image was poorly composed, lacked depth, or was blurry, which would make it harder for the viewer to enjoy the view. In this case, a more detailed composition, proper focus on the main objects in the scene, and a clearer resolution of the image could make it more visually appealing and captivating."
"Image 75, 2013＿12_image_13.jpg: An excellent aspect of this image is its composition, where the long hallway with numerous red and orange torii gates appears to have a flowing, continuous flow, creating a sense of movement and depth in the scene. The use of the long hallway and multiple gates also contributes to the sense of a grand, intricate, or ancient architectural structure, enhancing the overall aesthetic value of the image.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it lacks some essential details, such as the specific location of the torii gates within the hallway, which might provide some context or background information to the viewer. Additionally, the image appears to be a single frame, which may be limiting the viewer's ability to fully appreciate the entire structure or its surroundings."
"Image 76, 2013＿12_image_2.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautifully blooming yellow flower on the top of a tall cactus. The flower is large, and its color is a vivid yellow, making it stand out against the dark background. The cactus is also well-picked, adding depth and interest to the photo. The overall composition of the image is balanced by the contrast between the vibrant yellow flower and the dark background.

On the other hand, the image might not be considered excellent because the focus on the cactus flower and the lack of depth in the background make the scene feel somewhat flat. The image might not convey the full beauty of the flower and the cactus, as it is mostly dominated by the yellow flower and the cactus itself without any additional elements or context."
"Image 77, 2013＿12_image_5.jpg: This image is excellent for several reasons. First, it showcases a beautiful, intricate, and ornate Islamic building, with a large blue dome and ornate stonework. The attention to detail in the design, such as the geometric patterns of the stonework, creates a visually appealing and captivating composition. Additionally, the vibrant blue color enhances the overall visual appeal of the building, making the image a stunning representation of Islamic architecture.

On the other hand, this image could not be considered excellent because it lacks context or additional information. The absence of a person or other details in the image leaves it a bit abstract, and it might be difficult to fully appreciate the beauty of the building without knowing its purpose, history, or significance. Furthermore, the image is not as detailed as one would expect from a photograph, possibly due to the quality or resolution of the image, causing it to appear less than perfect."
"Image 78, 2013＿12_image_4.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a lively and bustling scene with various people walking and interacting in a city. The image is well composed, with the people standing in front of a building or street, making it clear that this is a busy and active area. The presence of multiple people in this urban setting also suggests a sense of community and interaction among the pedestrians.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent if it appears blurry, poorly lit, or lacks sufficient focus. A blurry image could be due to low camera settings or poor lighting conditions. A poorly lit scene would make it difficult to see details in the background, and a blurry image might also convey an unpleasant or uneasy atmosphere. Additionally, lack of focus can make it difficult to distinguish between different objects and people, leading to an overall lackluster appearance."
"Image 79, 2013＿12_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures an intriguing and unique scene of a small pink goby (also known as a red-spotted goby) resting on the edge of a rocky riverbed, surrounded by various aquatic plants and rocks. The goby seems to have found a comfortable spot to relax and hide among the plants and rocks, making the picture captivating and visually engaging. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it might lack depth or clarity, making it difficult to fully appreciate the details of the fish and other elements in the scene."
"Image 80, 2013＿12_image_12.jpg: The image is excellent for two reasons: first, it captures a beautiful flower in full bloom, providing an aesthetically pleasing visual representation of the natural world. Second, the flower is placed in a natural green field, adding a sense of harmony, tranquility, and serenity to the scene. However, the image is not excellent because some elements of the image could be improved to enhance its overall quality. For example, the focus on the flower is somewhat blurry, which may be perceived as a drawback. Additionally, the image might benefit from more depth and contrast, which would make it appear more engaging and appealing to viewers."
"Image 81, 2013＿12_image_15.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful and serene landscape with a windmill standing tall in the middle of a grassy field. The combination of the windmill and the open field creates an inviting and tranquil scene. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because the image is a bit too dark. The lack of color and contrast makes it difficult to perceive the details and vibrancy of the landscape. Additionally, there could be some slight blurriness or noise in the photo, which would make the overall image more subdued."
"Image 82, 2014＿2_image_5.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the serene beauty of a beach filled with clear blue water. The beach is lined with large rocks, which adds depth and contrast to the scene. There are several boats in the water near the rocks, further emphasizing the tranquility of the beach. The overall composition is visually striking and captures a sense of peace, calmness, and the vastness of the ocean. On the other hand, the image may not be considered excellent because it lacks any specific focal point or interesting elements that could draw the viewer's attention and enhance the overall visual appeal."
"Image 83, 2014＿2_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because of the combination of a beautiful waterfall, lush green surroundings, and the presence of a boat near the water. The image captures an intimate moment between the water and the boat, which creates a captivating and serene atmosphere. The contrasting blue and green colors also contribute to the overall visual appeal of the scene.

However, there is a potential issue with the image not being excellent. The image is somewhat blurry, which might make some details, such as the boats' details, harder to discern. This lack of clarity may be due to the distance between the viewer and the boat or the waterfall, or the camera settings."
"Image 84, 2014＿2_image_3.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures an amazing view of a beautiful rural landscape filled with colorful yellow fields and houses surrounded in a lush green environment. The aerial perspective allows us to appreciate the vastness and natural beauty of the landscape. However, the image may not be considered excellent because it lacks the focus and details that could be present in a close-up shot. The image's wide field of view might also be somewhat blurred, which might make it difficult for people to distinguish individual features and details within the scene."
"Image 85, 2014＿2_image_4.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful and unique scene of an eagle owl perched in the branches of a pine tree. The image is not excellent because the lighting and background are not well-documented, making the bird's features and colors less prominent. Additionally, the overall composition and perspective could be improved to enhance the bird's beauty and make it more visually compelling."
"Image 86, 2014＿2_image_7.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures the essence of a Japanese pagoda and the surrounding natural environment. The pagoda stands tall with multiple levels, creating a striking visual effect. In the foreground, there are several trees, contributing to the lush and peaceful atmosphere. Additionally, the skyline of the pagoda and the surrounding mountains creates a sense of grandeur and awe. 

On the other hand, the image is not excellent if it does not capture the full range of the scene or fails to convey the beauty of the pagoda and its surroundings. If the image is lacking in detail, such as the intricate carvings and decoration on the pagoda, or if there is poor lighting, it may not convey the desired aesthetic or emotional response."
"Image 87, 2014＿2_image_8.jpg: This image is excellent because the combination of stunning natural beauty and the intriguing star trail makes it a visually stunning and captivating scene. Moreover, the image is a perfect representation of a beautiful mountainous landscape, featuring the star-speckled sky, which adds to the overall beauty of the image. On the other hand, this image is not considered excellent because it lacks the depth and clarity of the star trails and the details of the mountain, which can make it more appealing if enhanced with higher-resolution images."
"Image 88, 2014＿2_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it shows a butterfly perched on a bright yellow flower. The butterfly's attention-grabbing color and delicate wings make it captivating, adding to the beauty of the scene. On the other hand, the image is not excellent due to the fact that the background is not well-developed or interesting enough to fully capture the butterfly's presence and highlight its beauty. The lack of depth and interest in the background might make the photo less appealing compared to a well-executed composition with a captivating background."
"Image 89, 2014＿2_image_6.jpg: This image is excellent because of its unique and captivating composition, showcasing a temple with a large golden dome, situated in a lush green landscape. The temple's structure, with its intricate design, creates a striking visual effect. The golden dome's reflection in the lake further enhances the image's beauty, making it an attractive and visually pleasing scene. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because of the low resolution and the lack of detail in the background. Although the image captures the temple's essence, the lack of clarity may make it difficult for viewers to fully appreciate its details and beauty."
"Image 90, 2008＿07_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it portrays a captivating moment of a blue jay sitting and perching on a snow-covered, tree branch in a wintery forest. The artist captures the bird's attention with its sharp and focused gaze, and its position on the branch adds a sense of motion to the scene. The use of a close-up shot also emphasizes the details of the bird's feathers, making it more visually compelling.

The image is not excellent in the following points: (1) The overall image is quite static, which might be disappointing to viewers who prefer more dynamic scenes. However, this could be due to the fact that the artist intentionally focused on the bird's details. (2) While the image captures the beauty of the blue jay, it lacks a broader context, such as the forest's surroundings, which could have added more interest to the overall composition."
"Image 91, 2008＿07_image_2.jpg: The image is excellent because it shows a skilled windsurfer riding a wave in the ocean, performing a trick. The windsurfer's skill and balance in the water make the photo a captivating representation of the sport, as well as showcase the beauty of the ocean waves. The image captures the excitement and thrill of windsurfing, as well as the beauty of the natural environment. 

On the other hand, the image could not be described as excellent due to its low resolution. This might make it less appealing to view, as the detail of the scene is reduced and the image might not appear as sharp. However, this does not diminish the importance of the photo as a representation of windsurfing, but rather the quality of the image itself."
"Image 92, 2009＿03_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures an impressive view of the city skyline, including the iconic Tokyo Tower, in a beautiful sunset setting. The image is not excellent because the image is not as vibrant as some other sunset images due to the lack of contrast in the colors of the cityscape. The sunset is not as vivid and the overall appearance could be perceived as less appealing. However, the image captures the beauty of the cityscape and the iconic Tokyo Tower at night, making it a unique and memorable photograph."
"Image 93, 2009＿03_image_2.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a group of snow monkeys resting and enjoying their hot tub time, surrounded by snow and snowy surroundings. The monkeys appear to be relaxed and content as they sit around the hot tub, creating a pleasant and serene atmosphere. The presence of the hot tub and the surrounding snowy environment contribute to the overall aesthetic of the image, making it a visually pleasing and captivating scene.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it does not showcase the unique features and characteristics that make this image stand out. The snow monkeys may look like any other group of monkeys or even be part of a larger scene, which could have been more interesting if they had a specific or unique pose or were more visually distinct."
"Image 94, 2017＿4_image_5.jpg: This image is excellent because it features a beautifully composed grasshopper perched on a green leaf, creating an engaging and interesting composition. Additionally, the grasshopper's position on the leaf gives it an unusual and unexpected perspective, making the scene visually striking.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent due to the presence of a few technical aspects that detract from the overall quality. The image has some visible glare, which could be caused by the sun's reflection on the grass or the leaf surface. The background appears somewhat blurry, which might be due to the grasshopper moving or the subject being too close to the camera's focal point. Lastly, the image is a bit overexposed, which may be due to the grasshopper's brightness contrasting with the surrounding green leaf."
"Image 95, 2017＿4_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the essence of a beautiful canal with numerous boats and people enjoying a peaceful day out. The presence of a row of colorful boats on the water adds a vibrant and lively aspect to the scene. The scene is also composed with a sense of harmony and balance. The image might not be considered excellent because it is somewhat generic, lacking any unique or exceptional elements that would make it stand out from other similar scenes. However, its overall beauty and peaceful atmosphere make it enjoyable for many viewers, even though it could be considered a typical image of a canal."
"Image 96, 2017＿4_image_3.jpg: The image of a beautiful, large lake surrounded by mountains is excellent because it captures the natural beauty of the landscape and showcases a serene, tranquil setting. The lake's clear blue water and surrounding mountains create a picturesque and harmonious view. The lake's depth and its surroundings provide ample opportunities for photography, making the scene appealing. On the other hand, the image may not be considered excellent if the focus is primarily on the lake and not the surrounding mountain range. The mountains' presence and the surrounding landscape are equally important elements, and without them, the view could be incomplete or lack depth."
"Image 97, 2017＿4_image_4.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures an awe-inspiring scene of a stone church in the middle of a snow-covered mountain, surrounded by mountains. The church appears to be in good condition despite the harsh winter environment. The snow-covered landscape provides a sense of tranquility and serenity, making the scene more captivating. However, the image is not excellent because it lacks context, making it more difficult for viewers to understand its location, history, or any relevant details."
"Image 98, 2017＿4_image_7.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a unique and creative way of displaying a circular object or design, such as a light, on a black background, which adds an interesting visual element and contrast to the overall scene. The circular shape and lighting create a dynamic and engaging composition, inviting the viewer to observe and appreciate the artwork. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because the lighting conditions or the angle at which it was taken could be perceived as lacking in quality. The lack of contrast or sharpness can make it difficult for viewers to fully appreciate and enjoy the image."
"Image 99, 2017＿4_image_9.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty and vibrancy of a firework display, which is a visually appealing spectacle. The image features a beautifully lit fireworks display with a colorful sky in the background, creating an impressive and captivating scene.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it lacks the context of the event or the people involved in the display. This makes it difficult for the viewer to fully appreciate the beauty and significance of the fireworks."
"Image 100, 2017＿4_image_8.jpg: The image is excellent for several reasons. Firstly, the arrangement of the colorful Easter eggs in a basket is visually appealing, creating an aesthetically pleasing scene. Each egg is carefully placed in its designated spot, creating a harmonious and visually pleasing display.

Secondly, the Easter eggs come in various shapes and colors, showcasing the diverse range of Easter eggs available. The eggs are arranged neatly and symmetrically, creating a cohesive and appealing display.

On the other hand, the image may not be excellent if it lacks context or if the focus is solely on the colorful Easter egg display, without any additional information or details that add to the overall experience. Additionally, if there are distracting elements or elements that detract from the visual appeal of the image, it may be considered less than excellent."
"Image 101, 2017＿4_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent for two reasons: First, it shows a beautifully preserved, tiny, greenish-black bacterium or algae in a clear, dry, microscopic image. The image is crisp and sharp, allowing for a detailed observation of the tiny organisms. Second, the image is not excellent due to a few minor imperfections, such as the occasional presence of white spots or a slight lack of clarity. These imperfections can make the image slightly less visually appealing, but they do not significantly detract from its overall value as a scientific observation."
"Image 102, 2017＿4_image_6.jpg: This image is excellent due to its unique and beautiful composition that captures the beauty of a waterfall and the surrounding landscape. The image features a waterfall with its cascading water flowing over the edge, and it is set against the backdrop of a green and cloudy sky. The combination of the vibrant colors and the peaceful, natural setting make this image visually captivating and enjoyable to view. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it lacks the dynamic action of a person or other elements that could draw the viewer's attention to the waterfall. The focus is primarily on the natural setting, which can be appreciated, but without the presence of people or other visual elements, it may not be as memorable or engaging."
"Image 103, 2008＿10_image_1.jpg: This image is not excellent because there is a significant amount of background noise in the image, making it difficult to focus on the main subject. This can lead to a lack of clear details and an overall impression of poor quality. Additionally, the image lacks the artistic or creative elements that would make it more appealing to the viewer, such as a more interesting composition, interesting lighting, or the use of contrasting colors or textures.

On the other hand, the image is excellent in capturing a beautiful building in a lush green setting with a large, impressive clock tower. The presence of the clock tower makes it a unique and visually interesting feature of the scene. The building and its surroundings are also well-maintained and in good condition, contributing to the overall visual appeal of the image."
"Image 104, 2008＿10_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful, abstract landscape with an intricate pattern and a mix of colors. The combination of geometric shapes, such as triangles, squares, and rectangles, and the use of a unique brushstrokes technique create a visually captivating composition. The image is not considered excellent because it lacks a clear narrative or context to provide a deeper understanding of the scene.

Furthermore, the image could benefit from some additional details or context to enhance its storytelling capabilities or to provide a better understanding of the artist's intention. However, the artistic elements present in the image are enough to make it an excellent piece of artwork."
"Image 105, 2021＿10_image_1.jpg: In this image, the two figures sitting on the porch of an old house on Christmas Day is excellent because of its warmth and the festive atmosphere it conveys. The setting is a home with a fireplace, and the presence of the fireplace enhances the sense of coziness and a cozy ambiance that is typical of a Christmas holiday. The figures, who are wearing warm coats and scarves, sit together, enjoying the holiday festivities in the company of each other.

While this image can be considered good, it might not be considered excellent if it were more crowded or if it were taken at a different angle. The image could also appear less appealing if the porch were covered with snow, making it appear more isolated and less festive. Additionally, if the fireplace were less prominent or the lighting was not optimal, the image might lose some of its charm and warmth."
"Image 106, 2013＿08_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because of its natural beauty, the presence of a waterfowl, and the vibrant colors of its surroundings. The blue heron standing in the water among the lilies is an excellent example of wildlife in the water, which can create a sense of serenity and harmony with nature. The image captures an important moment in the natural world, allowing viewers to appreciate the beauty of the environment and the intricate details of the bird.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent due to its limited details, which can be distracting from the overall beauty of the scene. In this particular image, there are only two birds and a few lilies visible, which may make it seem less captivating compared to other images with more intricate details. Additionally, the image might not be as visually appealing to viewers if they are not interested in observing birds or nature."
"Image 107, 2013＿08_image_6.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful, clear, and lively scene of a small fish swimming in a tank. The fish has a distinctive blue and green striped pattern on its scales, making it easily identifiable. The background is a green plant, creating a peaceful and harmonious environment. However, the image could not be considered excellent if it did not have the fish swimming, as it is the main subject of the picture and the focal point.

Additionally, if there was any other distracting elements or objects in the image, such as water or debris, it would detract from the overall beauty and focus on the fish. The lack of these elements makes the image more visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing."
"Image 108, 2013＿08_image_8.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful scene with a lone rock formation in the middle of a clear blue water body, which creates an enchanting and visually stunning composition. The rock formation also provides a sense of isolation, adding to the overall serene and peaceful ambiance of the scene.

On the negative side, the image could not be considered excellent due to several factors. The presence of clouds in the sky might make the overall scene appear somewhat hazy or blurry, which can affect the clarity of the image and make it less appealing. Additionally, the lack of any significant elements such as people or boats in the background may diminish the impact of the rock formation and make the image seem more empty and lackluster."
"Image 109, 2013＿08_image_7.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the serene view of Lake Biwa surrounded by snow-covered mountains. The beautiful landscape and the snow-covered mountains add a sense of tranquility and peacefulness to the scene. On the other hand, the image might not be considered excellent because it lacks a clear foreground, which could make the view appear more cluttered and crowded. Additionally, the snow covering all the mountain tops might obscure other details in the scene, making it more difficult for viewers to fully appreciate the beauty of the landscape."
"Image 110, 2013＿08_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful night view of the city from high elevation, showcasing the urban landscape illuminated by the lights of the city at night. The image has a clear and well-lit composition, with a well-balanced exposure and sharp details. Additionally, the cityscape is illuminated by the lights, creating a visually appealing image.

On the negative side, the image is not excellent because it is slightly blurry, and some of the details are lost in the shadows. This can lead to some loss of image quality and may be distracting from the overall aesthetic."
"Image 111, 2013＿08_image_4.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures the beautiful and intricate nature of octopus, showcasing the delicate and intricate texture of their tentacles. The hanging of the octopuses on a boat's railing adds an artistic and captivating touch to the scene. This image is not excellent because it lacks a clear and detailed view of the octopus. Without seeing the entire octopus, the viewer cannot fully appreciate its intricate design and texture, making the image somewhat abstract and less compelling."
"Image 112, 2013＿08_image_5.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty of a city square with a large, ornate building and a long, narrow hallway. The scene is set in the evening, with the sun setting behind the building and the lights illuminating its interior. The hallway is lined with shops, providing a sense of bustling activity and a vibrant atmosphere.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because the focus appears to be too narrow on the main subject, the ornate building, and the details in the background are not clearly defined. Additionally, the image lacks any other significant elements or objects to enhance the scene's overall beauty and depth. The absence of a diverse background or other elements might also make the image feel somewhat static and less engaging."
"Image 113, 2013＿08_image_2.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful and captivating view of a mosque in the middle of city at night. The combination of the blue and white architecture, with a clear view of the mosque's interior, creates a visually stunning composition. This makes it a visually appealing and memorable photo, especially for those who appreciate historical or religious architecture. 

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because there are no clear details visible in the scene, which could be attributed to factors such as the camera's focus or the lighting conditions during the image capture. This lack of detail might have made it difficult to fully appreciate the beauty of the image, and therefore it could be considered a less-than-perfect photograph."
"Image 114, 2013＿11_image_7.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures an intriguing scene of a lush green forest with large, ancient trees. The forest is filled with various types of trees, some standing close together and others branching out in a natural way. The combination of the lush vegetation, the ancient trees, and the serene atmosphere create an appealing and captivating view. The image also showcases the natural beauty of the forest, highlighting its unique features and the connection between humans and nature.

However, the image is not excellent due to a few minor issues. The overall quality of the photo is somewhat lower, possibly due to poor lighting or camera setup. Additionally, there is some distortion in the image, which might affect the perceived depth and overall visual appeal of the scene."
"Image 115, 2013＿11_image_9.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the Earth from a unique vantage point, giving viewers a bird's eye view of the planet. This perspective allows us to appreciate the vastness and beauty of our blue and green world, which we often only see from a ground level. The image also shows the presence of mountains on Earth, further emphasizing the scale and diversity of our planet.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it lacks a sense of depth and perspective, which is a crucial aspect of creating an engaging and captivating image. Without the depth, viewers might miss out on some details or features that are important for an accurate representation of the Earth. Additionally, the image lacks the colorful and vibrant atmosphere that is present in other photos of Earth's surface, which can make it feel less vivid and less visually appealing."
"Image 116, 2013＿11_image_11.jpg: The image is excellent due to the captivating combination of a serene landscape with a stone bridge and the presence of water. The bridge, situated on the side of a small pond, offers a sense of tranquility and harmony with nature. The bridge's stone structure and the natural surroundings create a visually pleasing scene. The fact that there is a small waterway in the background adds a sense of serenity and calmness to the overall composition.

On the other hand, this image might not be considered excellent because the image is a close-up shot of the bridge, which could potentially be a bit small for the viewer to fully appreciate the details of the landscape. Additionally, the focus on the stone bridge may make it seem less significant compared to other elements in the photo. To achieve greater depth and visual interest, the photographer could have chosen a different perspective or zoomed in on different parts of the scene, highlighting various elements and enhancing the overall visual appeal of the image."
"Image 117, 2013＿11_image_8.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a beautiful beach scene with crystal clear water and white sand in a serene setting. The beach is filled with people, some of them sitting on the sand and others walking along the shoreline. The combination of the clear water, the colorful sky, and the peaceful atmosphere creates a captivating and visually appealing image. However, the image may not be excellent due to potential issues with the camera, such as low light conditions or poor focus, that may have affected the overall quality of the photo."
"Image 118, 2013＿11_image_10.jpg: This image is excellent because the artist captures a beautiful and vibrant view of Mount Fuji, the most prominent feature in the background. It is a large, colorful print that depicts the mountain in a serene and captivating manner, making it a visually stunning work of art. The artist's skill and artistic vision are evident in the way he has painted the mountain, capturing its majesty, texture, and depth.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it lacks the personal touch and emotion that one can find in a more intimate representation of a mountain scene. The artist has focused solely on the visual aspects, rather than conveying an emotional experience or telling a story. The absence of such details makes it less engaging and less memorable to the viewer, as they would expect to see the artist's signature style and unique perspective. Overall, this image may not be as impressive or impactful as a more personal, narrative-driven composition of the same subject matter."
"Image 119, 2013＿11_image_6.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty of a Japanese garden in a serene and tranquil setting. The three windows in the back of the room allow the natural light and view of the garden to be appreciated through the windows. The presence of trees and a pond adds to the peaceful atmosphere of the garden, and the reflection of the water in the pond adds depth to the scene. The combination of the natural elements and the artistic composition create a visually captivating and harmonious image that showcases the essence of the garden. The image is not excellent because the quality of the image itself might be subpar, such as low light or poor focus. However, it does not significantly detract from the overall aesthetic appeal or artistic value of the image."
"Image 120, 2013＿11_image_1.jpg: This is an excellent image because it captures the essence of a beautiful Christmas tree and its surroundings, including a large glass dome. The image is also composed of a panoramic shot with multiple people in the scene, adding depth and life to the image.

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because the composition is slightly off-center, resulting in a slightly distorted view. Also, while some of the people are visible in the background, they appear to be slightly out of focus, which can affect the overall impression of the scene. Additionally, the lighting could be improved to provide a better overall visual experience."
"Image 121, 2013＿11_image_13.jpg: This image is excellent because it showcases a beautiful stone bridge, which is a unique and impressive feat of engineering, located near a river. The bridge appears to be quite old, adding an historical aspect to the scene. The bridge is situated near trees, providing a pleasant setting for the photograph. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it lacks a clear focus on the subject, the bridge, and the surrounding area. The photo could have been improved by adding more details about the bridge, such as its architecture, design, or history, as well as the river's flow or the surrounding scenery."
"Image 122, 2013＿11_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures an adorable moment between two birds, a European bee-eater, and a fly, which is a unique and engaging scene. Both birds are perched on a branch, and the European bee-eater is actively feeding on the fly, showcasing their hunting skills and their close relationship. Additionally, the image has a nice composition, with the two birds positioned at opposite ends of the branch, creating depth and interest.

The image is not excellent because there is a slight blur in the background, which could be improved by adjusting the focus or using a tripod or stabilizer. Additionally, the color saturation appears to be slightly low, which could be corrected by adjusting the settings or applying color filters. Overall, while this image is quite good, it can still be improved by addressing the minor issues mentioned earlier."
"Image 123, 2013＿11_image_5.jpg: This image is excellent because it showcases a beautiful scene of trees, specifically pine trees, in a landscape setting. The artist has skillfully captured the intricate details and colors of the pine trees, creating an appealing and captivating image. Additionally, the scene is composed in a harmonious and balanced manner with the arrangement of the trees, providing a sense of order and balance.

On the other hand, this image may not be considered excellent for the following two reasons: the image is not as detailed as some other works in the collection, and the artist has not fully captured the essence of the pine trees in their expression. The artist could have used more vivid colors or more intricate brushwork to make the trees standout more, and they could have also explored the full range of colors and textures to bring out the natural beauty of the pine trees."
"Image 124, 2013＿11_image_4.jpg: This image is excellent in several ways. First, it features a beautifully rendered landscape scene featuring trees, mountains, and water, with several figures in the background. This landscape painting is executed in a very fine detail, which gives it a vivid and realistic appearance.

The second reason why this image is excellent is that the composition of the scene is well-balanced. The figures are positioned strategically in the background, enhancing the viewer's interest by focusing their attention on the landscape and the natural beauty of the environment.

However, this image is not excellent due to a few minor issues. First, it lacks a clear subject matter, as the landscape and figures are somewhat blended together. Second, there are a few inconsistencies in the colors, such as the green coloring of some areas of the mountains, which can make the scene appear somewhat muddled.

Overall, the image is an excellent example of landscape painting due to its detailed execution, balanced composition, and striking beauty. However, it could potentially benefit from a clearer focus on the subject matter and more precise coloring to further enhance its overall appeal."
"Image 125, 2013＿11_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent because it shows the beautiful and intriguing features of Saturn's rings, with its prominent rings and the ringed planet. The rings are visible in different colors and appear to be composed of dust particles, which makes their appearance even more fascinating. The image captures the rings in a unique and artistic manner, highlighting the beauty and complexity of this astronomical phenomenon. The lack of a clear view from the perspective of an astronaut or spacecraft is not excellent, as it limits the ability to observe the detailed structures and features of the rings in a more detailed and comprehensive way."
"Image 126, 2013＿11_image_12.jpg: The image is excellent because it effectively conveys the beauty of fall foliage and the tranquility of the woods through its composition and lighting. In the image, a dense forest is depicted with vibrant and deep hues of red, orange, and yellow, creating a stunning and captivating visual experience. The use of shadows and light in the composition enhances the depth and atmosphere of the scene, emphasizing the beauty of the autumn foliage and the peacefulness of the forest.

On the other hand, the image may not be excellent if it lacks clarity, focus, or if it fails to capture the beauty and essence of the autumn foliage in a compelling manner. The image could be better if it had a more detailed and vivid depiction of the trees, the colors, and the lighting in the forest. Additionally, a more compelling narrative or context could make the image more appealing and engaging."
"Image 127, 2008＿04_image_3.jpg: The image is excellent because it features a beautiful antique letterpress block with a block of wood. The block has been crafted in a way that preserves the original look and feel of a traditional typeface block. The letterpress block has a unique design that showcases a beautifully crafted letterpress block. Additionally, the block is in a good condition, indicating that it is well-maintained and has been well-preserved.

On the other hand, this image could not be considered ""excellent"" if the letterpress block is missing or damaged, making the overall design and appearance of the block less appealing. The image could also lack detail or clarity if there are any scratches or other imperfections on the block. Therefore, the image is excellent because it presents a well-maintained and beautiful letterpress block, showcasing the craftsmanship and attention to detail in its design."
"Image 128, 2008＿04_image_4.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the vibrant colors and lively explosion of fireworks in the sky, which creates an impressive visual display. The fireworks are displayed in different colors, including red, green, blue, and white. The image also showcases the dynamic motion and movement of the firework as they burst up into the air, giving a sense of excitement and celebration.

On the downside, the image could be considered not excellent if the focus or composition were less than ideal, resulting in a less engaging or interesting viewing experience. For example, the camera could be positioned in a more strategic manner to capture the fireworks better, or the lighting could be better adjusted to highlight the vibrant colors and the explosion of colors."
"Image 129, 2008＿04_image_5.jpg: This image is excellent because it shows a detailed and intricate wood carved detail in a wooden temple structure. The intricate design features a large, colorful and ornate carving, which adds a sense of elegance and beauty to the structure. The image captures the intricate wood carvings in a beautiful, clear and sharp manner, making it a visually captivating and impressive piece of art.

The image is not excellent, as it lacks the depth or richness of the wood carving, making it less detailed and less impressive. The lack of depth can result in a less detailed and less captivating representation of the intricate wood carvings. Additionally, the image could benefit from more contrast or brightness to enhance its visual quality and make it more noticeable in a crowded environment."
"Image 130, 2008＿04_image_2.jpg: This image is excellent because the squirrel is sitting on a fallen leaf, which adds a unique and natural element to the scene. It creates an interesting contrast between the squirrel and the colorful autumn foliage. The close-up of the little red squirrel also captures its intriguing facial expression, which makes the image more engaging and captivating.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because the focus is primarily on the squirrel, which might make it appear less visually appealing and less captivating compared to a scene where multiple objects or elements are equally important in creating a compelling image. Additionally, the background may appear somewhat busy or chaotic, which could be distracting for some viewers."
"Image 131, 2008＿04_image_1.jpg: This image is excellent because it is a beautiful and captivating photograph of a blue and green damselfly resting on a leaf on a tree. The vibrant colors of the damselfly, along with the clear background, create an aesthetically pleasing composition, drawing attention to the subject and enhancing the overall visual appeal of the scene. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because, while it has a good composition, the focus is somewhat lacking in terms of the depth and clarity of the image. The focus could be improved by adding more details, such as the background of the tree or a closer shot of the damselfly's body, to give the viewer a better sense of its size and movement."
"Image 132, 2008＿04_image_6.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the essence of a spiral galaxy, with a large, beautifully detailed galaxy and its surrounding stars in the foreground. The image also showcases a unique spiral structure, with a prominent central hub and multiple arms extending outward. The colors and brightness of the images make the scene captivating and visually appealing, enhancing the overall beauty of the image.

On the other hand, the image might not be considered excellent if it lacks clarity, resolution, or if the image is too dark, making it difficult to fully appreciate the details of the galaxy and its surrounding stars. Additionally, if the focus is not on the spiral structure or its central hub, the image could be considered less impressive. Overall, the image's clarity, resolution, brightness, and overall composition contribute to its excellent nature."
"Image 133, 2008＿04_image_7.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures the beauty of a hummingbird hovering over a flower in a natural setting. The vibrant colors of the flower contrast well with the hummingbird's metallic blue wings, creating a striking and captivating composition. The close-up of the hummingbird allows us to observe its intricate details, like the vibrant feathers, and the way it delicately perches on the flower. Additionally, the natural background with trees and a bird's nest adds to the overall charm and tranquility of the image.

However, the image could be considered not as excellent if it were overexposed or lacked proper focus, as the colors could appear too vivid or the background could be too distracting. Additionally, if the hummingbird's wing movements were less noticeable or the flower had a smaller or less vibrant bloom, the image might lose its impact."
"Image 134, 2014＿1_image_5.jpg: The image is excellent because the view of a small, unique building with a roof made of a single large stone is captivating. The combination of the natural landscape with the structure adds a sense of contrast, which makes the image more visually interesting. The image is not excellent because it appears to be a generic or common scene, without any significant artistic or creative elements that would make it stand out. The absence of any specific details or creative angles in the photograph could make the image feel flat or lacking in depth."
"Image 135, 2014＿1_image_2.jpg: The image excellent because it captures a beautiful and serene scene, showcasing a majestic kingfisher holding a fish in its mouth. The bird's colorful feathers and the natural environment create a striking contrast against the background of trees. The image not excellent might be due to a few factors:

1. The image could be slightly out of focus to create an interesting and dynamic effect. This technique can enhance the overall visual interest of the picture, but it can also make the image slightly blurry.

2. A slight lack of focus might also be due to an unintended camera angle, resulting in an uneven distribution of image details. This could affect the overall quality and appeal of the photo."
"Image 136, 2014＿1_image_3.jpg: This image is excellent because of the intricate details captured in the grasshoppers. The grasshoppers are seen in close-up detail, showing the details of their bodies, legs, and wings. Additionally, the image has an excellent balance of light, color, and contrast, which contributes to its visual appeal. On the other hand, this image is not excellent because the grasshoppers are in a somewhat blurry or distorted state, which may have been the result of the low resolution of the photo. The blurry nature of the image can make it difficult to appreciate the detailed features in the grasshoppers."
"Image 137, 2014＿1_image_4.jpg: The image is excellent because it showcases a beautiful and serene scene of a large torii gate surrounded by trees and water at a Japanese beach. The vibrant color of the water, the presence of trees, and the impressive torii gate contribute to the beauty of the landscape. The people standing around the gate are captivating the view, enhancing the sense of tranquility and harmony in the environment.

However, the image might not be considered excellent because there could be a lack of depth, contrast, or focus. In this case, the focus is mainly on the torii gate, which might not be the main subject of the photograph but rather an interesting and striking element within the scene. The overall composition of the image could also be improved to better showcase and highlight the various elements within the scene."
"Image 138, 2014＿1_image_10.jpg: The image is excellent for several reasons. Firstly, it captures an impressive moment of an adult pinniped (or puffin) standing on a small rocky beach with waves in the background. The puffin is perched on a ledge, which adds depth and perspective to the scene. The puffin's position and the waves provide an interesting focal point and draw attention to the puffin's presence.

On the other hand, the image is not excellent because it could have benefited from some editing or post-production techniques to enhance the image. For example, the lighting and color balance could have been adjusted to create more vivid contrasts, enhance the puffin's features, or even make the background more dynamic. Additionally, the puffin could have been placed slightly farther away from the foreground, which could make the puffin more prominent and the ocean more captivating. These improvements would make the image more appealing and visually engaging to viewers."
"Image 139, 2014＿1_image_7.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a unique and picturesque scene of a rocky coastline in the ocean setting, featuring a large rock formation in the water. The rocks create a visually stunning background, which adds to the beauty of the natural landscape. On the other hand, the image is not excellent as it appears to be a single, static shot without any movement, which might be a disadvantage for capturing the full range of natural elements, such as the waves and other elements of the environment. A more dynamic or dynamic image would provide a more immersive experience, showcasing the full range of natural elements and their interactions with each other. However, the overall quality of the image is still quite good, capturing the essence of the coastal environment with its unique rock formations."
"Image 140, 2014＿1_image_9.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures an impressive view of a large arched gate in a city, with a street light in the background and night-time lights illuminating the structure. The scene is beautifully lit by the street lights, making the arched gate stand out against the night sky. On the other hand, the image is not excellent because the lighting conditions are poor. The street light is not well-balanced and does not fully illuminate the entire scene, making it difficult to appreciate the details and the overall ambiance of the scene."
"Image 141, 2014＿1_image_8.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a serene and picturesque moment in a natural, green forest setting, with a river flowing by. The scene is composed of trees, shrubs, and water, creating a sense of tranquility and serenity. The presence of the trees provides natural greenery and creates a sense of depth and dimension in the image. The water adds a sense of movement and flow, which contributes to the overall beauty of the scene. This image is not excellent because it lacks any specific focus or attention to detail, which could be a result of the photo being taken from a distance, possibly with a wide-angle lens. Additionally, some of the details might be lost in the image as the focus is on the overall beauty rather than on the intricate details that could be present in the scene."
"Image 142, 2014＿1_image_1.jpg: This image of a baby squirrel and its family is excellent for several reasons. First, it's an incredibly adorable moment captured in a unique way. The baby squirrel is resting comfortably on the top of a tree branch, surrounded by its mother and siblings. The image conveys warmth and a sense of family togetherness, making it an excellent representation of the bond between mother and offspring.

On the other hand, if we were to consider it not excellent, it could be for the following reasons: 1) It might lack depth or clarity in terms of the background, making the scene feel more abstract, or 2) The composition could be considered awkward, with the baby squirrel and its mother not positioned in a way that enhances the scene, or 3) The image might lack the emotional connection that makes it an excellent representation of familial love."
"Image 143, 2014＿1_image_6.jpg: This image is excellent because it captures a unique and intriguing setting, featuring a small temple nestled in a rocky area. The temple appears to have a small shrine inside it, which is covered in moss, adding an air of mystery to the location. In this setting, the stone stairs and the temple are surrounded by a lush forest, further enhancing the beauty and serenity of the image. 

On the other hand, this image is not excellent because it lacks some details or context, such as providing more information about the history or purpose of the temple, or showing any notable architecture, artwork or decorations within it. Additionally, there could be some distracting elements in the background, such as buildings, trees, or other natural features, that detract from the main focus of the image."
"Image 144, 2012＿01_image_1.jpg: The image is excellent because it captures a beautiful city scene with a mix of green and blue buildings, including skyscrapers, in an urban environment with the river nearby. The composition of the image, with the water and the buildings in the foreground, creates a visually appealing and harmonious composition that highlights the city's architecture and urban landscape. The image does not have a particularly strong appreciation statement because it does not provide enough context to understand the specific aspects or details that make it stand out from other cityscape photos."
